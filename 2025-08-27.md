### 🎯 Key Events

**1. Russia's invasion of Ukraine**
- **Significance:** 0.80/1.0
- **Key Actors:** Russia, Ukraine
- **Location:** Ukraine
- **Timing:** ongoing since February 2022

### 🔮 Causal Predictions

**Event:** Russia's invasion of Ukraine

⚡ **1. Increased inflation rates globally**
- **Confidence:** 80%
- **Timeframe:** Immediate
- **Reasoning:** The invasion disrupts supply chains, particularly for energy and food, leading to immediate price hikes.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** consumers, businesses, governments
- **Historical Precedent:** Previous conflicts, such as the Gulf War, led to spikes in oil prices and inflation.
- **Key Contingency:** If diplomatic resolutions are reached quickly, the inflation impact may be mitigated.

📅 **2. Central banks may increase interest rates**
- **Confidence:** 75%
- **Timeframe:** Short-Term
- **Reasoning:** To combat rising inflation, central banks may tighten monetary policy, leading to higher borrowing costs.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** borrowers, investors, financial institutions
- **Historical Precedent:** In response to inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve raised rates during the 1970s oil crisis.
- **Key Contingency:** If inflation is perceived as temporary, central banks might delay rate hikes.

📆 **3. Shift in global energy markets**
- **Confidence:** 70%
- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term
- **Reasoning:** Countries may seek alternative energy sources to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas, leading to long-term shifts in energy policy.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** energy companies, governments, consumers
- **Historical Precedent:** Post-2014 sanctions on Russia led to increased investments in renewable energy in Europe.
- **Key Contingency:** If the conflict escalates, energy supply disruptions could worsen, accelerating the shift.

### 🎯 Key Events

**1. Typical annual household energy bill to rise by £35**
- **Significance:** 0.80/1.0
- **Key Actors:** UK households, energy suppliers, regulatory bodies
- **Location:** United Kingdom
- **Timing:** October 2023

### 🔮 Causal Predictions

**Event:** Typical annual household energy bill to rise by £35

⚡ **1. Increased financial burden on households**

- **Timeframe:** Short-Term
- **Reasoning:** With higher energy costs, households may cut back on discretionary spending, affecting the economy.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** retailers, service providers, government
- **Historical Precedent:** Similar past increases in living costs have led to reduced consumer spending.
- **Key Contingency:** If wages increase or inflation decreases, spending may not decline as significantly.

📆 **3. Increased calls for government intervention or policy changes**
- **Confidence:** 70%
- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term
- **Reasoning:** Rising energy costs may lead to public pressure on the government to intervene or implement price controls.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** government, energy regulators, consumer advocacy groups
