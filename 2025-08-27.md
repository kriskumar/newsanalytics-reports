### 🔮 Causal Predictions

**Event:** Russia's invasion of Ukraine

- **Confidence:** 80%
- **Timeframe:** Immediate
- **Reasoning:** The invasion disrupts supply chains, particularly for energy and food, leading to immediate price hikes.

- **Reasoning:** With higher energy costs, households may cut back on discretionary spending, affecting the economy.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** retailers, service providers, government
- **Historical Precedent:** Similar past increases in living costs have led to reduced consumer spending.
- **Key Contingency:** If wages increase or inflation decreases, spending may not decline as significantly.

📆 **3. Increased calls for government intervention or policy changes**
- **Confidence:** 70%
- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term
- **Reasoning:** Rising energy costs may lead to public pressure on the government to intervene or implement price controls.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** government, energy regulators, consumer advocacy groups
