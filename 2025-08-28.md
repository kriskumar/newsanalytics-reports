- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term

### 🎯 Key Events

**1. Pandemic drives negative outlook for global asset managers and emerging markets financial institutions**
- **Significance:** 0.80/1.0
- **Key Actors:** global asset managers, emerging markets financial institutions, Moody's
- **Location:** global
- **Timing:** during the pandemic

### 🔮 Causal Predictions

**Event:** Pandemic drives negative outlook for global asset managers and emerging markets financial institutions

📅 **1. Decrease in investment and capital inflows into emerging markets**
- **Confidence:** 80%
- **Timeframe:** Short-Term
- **Reasoning:** As asset managers reassess risk profiles due to the pandemic, they are likely to pull back investments in emerging markets, leading to reduced capital inflows.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** emerging market economies, local businesses, investors
- **Historical Precedent:** Similar trends were observed during the 2008 financial crisis when investors withdrew from high-risk markets.
- **Key Contingency:** If the pandemic situation improves rapidly or if there are significant government interventions to stabilize markets, the outcome may differ.

⚡ **2. Increased volatility in global financial markets**
- **Confidence:** 75%
- **Timeframe:** Immediate
- **Reasoning:** Negative outlooks from Moody's can trigger panic selling and increased volatility as investors react to perceived risks.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** global investors, financial institutions, regulators
- **Historical Precedent:** Market volatility spikes often follow negative economic forecasts, as seen during the initial COVID-19 outbreak.
- **Key Contingency:** If there are positive economic indicators or successful vaccine rollouts, market reactions could stabilize.

📆 **3. Potential for regulatory changes in financial markets**
- **Confidence:** 70%
- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term
- **Reasoning:** As financial institutions face challenges, regulators might introduce new policies to enhance market stability and protect investors.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** financial regulators, asset managers, investors
- **Historical Precedent:** Post-2008 financial crisis, many countries implemented stricter regulations to prevent similar downturns.
- **Key Contingency:** If the economic situation improves or if there is significant pushback from financial institutions, regulatory changes may be less severe.

- **Reasoning:** Affected countries may impose their own tariffs in response, impacting U.S. exports.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** U.S. exporters, foreign governments
- **Historical Precedent:** The trade war with China saw reciprocal tariffs affecting various sectors.
- **Key Contingency:** If diplomatic negotiations succeed, retaliatory measures may be reduced.

📆 **3. Long-term structural changes in supply chains**
- **Confidence:** 75%
- **Timeframe:** Medium-Term
- **Reasoning:** Businesses may seek to relocate production or source materials from countries with lower tariffs.
- **Affected Stakeholders:** manufacturers, global supply chain networks
- **Historical Precedent:** Companies have shifted supply chains in response to previous trade policies.
